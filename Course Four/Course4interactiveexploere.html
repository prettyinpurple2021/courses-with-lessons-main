<!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Grays, Whites, Accent Blue) -->
<!-- Application Structure Plan: A 3-tab SPA (Overview, Curriculum, Final Project). Overview features a chart of activity types. Curriculum uses a 2-column layout with a sticky left nav to dynamically load full lesson plans into the right content area. Final Project shows project details and an exam breakdown bar chart. This structure is best for exploring a course syllabus, allowing users to see the high-level structure and drill down into specific details (lessons) easily. -->
<!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1) Overview Donut Chart (Chart.js): Goal=Inform. Shows breakdown of 38 learning activities by type (Tool Exploration, Case Study, Strategic, Peer Collab, Creative) to visualize the course's hands-on nature. 2) Curriculum JS Renderer: Goal=Organize. Dynamically populates HTML to display full lesson plans, making the 12-lesson structure navigable. 3) Final Project Bar Chart (Chart.js): Goal=Inform. Shows breakdown of 25 final exam questions by type (MCQ, T/F, etc.) to clarify the assessment. All textual content is parsed from the 14 source files and stored in a JS object. -->

Most solopreneurs are trapped in 'The Manual Mindset,' believing 'It's faster if I just do it myself.' This is a lie that keeps businesses small. The 'Automate-First' Mindset is a strategic shift. It trains you to stop seeing your business as a list of *tasks* and to start seeing it as a system of *processes*. You'll learn to ruthlessly analyze every action by its 'Return on Time Invested' (ROTI). The goal is to install a new mental filter that, before you *do* any repetitive task, makes you ask: 'How can I *automate* this so I never have to do it again?'</p>",

Right now, your business processes (like 'new lead to client' or 'new idea to blog post') probably live in your head. This is a single point of failure and makes automation impossible. This lesson teaches you to become a 'business cartographer'—a person who maps processes. By creating a visual flowchart, you pull the process *out* of your brain and onto the screen. This allows you to see every step, every decision point, and every bottleneck. You'll see *exactly* where a manual task is breaking your flow, and more importantly, you'll identify the *precise* points where an automation 'trigger' can take over.</p>",

This 'digital clutter' is a primary source of burnout. An Operations Hub, or 'Single Source of Truth' (SSOT), fixes this. It is a centralized, digital dashboard you build *yourself* (in a tool like Notion or Airtable) to manage your entire business from one screen. It’s not just a 'project manager'; it’s your 'Business HQ.' It links your Projects, Clients, Content, Tasks, and SOPs together in one place, giving you 10-second access to any piece of information and enabling much more powerful automations.</p>",

This lesson is your boot camp for these tools.
